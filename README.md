# Metal Puzzles

Port of [srush/GPU-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles) to [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_API) using [MLX Custom Kernals](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/dev/custom_metal_kernels.html). Inspired by [@awnihannun](https://x.com/awnihannun/status/1833376670063202536)!

GPUs are crucial in machine learning because they can process data on a massively parallel scale. While it's possible to become an expert in machine learning without writing any GPU code, building intuition is challenging when you're only working through layers of abstraction. Additionally, as models grow in complexity, the need for developers to write efficient, high-performance kernels becomes increasingly important to leverage the power of modern hardware.

Whether you're new to GPU programming or have experience with CUDA, the following puzzles provide a straightforward way to learn on an Apple Silicon computer. In the following exercises, you'll use the `mx.fast.metal_kernel()` function from Apple's [mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) framework, which allows you to write custom Metal kernels through a Python/C++ API. For verification purposes, I've created a wrapper class around `mx.fast.metal_kernel()` called `MetalKernel`, but the interface remains identical.

If you're interested in more material, check out the [MLX Custom Metal Kernels Documentation](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/dev/custom_metal_kernels.html) and the [Metal Shading Language specification](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf).

```sh
pip install -qqq git+https://github.com/danoneata/chalk@srush-patch-1
pip install mlx
```

```python
import mlx.core as mx
from utils import MetalKernel, MetalProblem
```

To run the `metal_puzzles.py` script, run `python3 metal_puzzles.py PUZZLE_NUMBER`, use 0 if you want to run tests of all puzzles at once.


## Puzzle 1: Map

Implement a "kernel" (GPU function) that adds 10 to each position of the array `a` and stores it in the array `out`.  You have 1 thread per position.

**Note:** The `source` string below is the body of your Metal kernel, the function signature will be automatically generated for you. Below you'll notice the `input_names` and `output_names` parameters. These define the parameters for your Metal kernel.

**Tip:** If you need a tool for debugging your Kernel read the [Metal Debugger](#metal-debugger) section below. Also, you can print out the generated Metal kernel by setting the environment variable `VERBOSE=1`.

```python
def map_spec(a: mx.array):
    return a + 10

def map_test(a: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint local_i = thread_position_in_grid.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 1 line)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="map",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 4
a = mx.arange(SIZE)
output_shape = (SIZE,)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Map",
    map_test,
    [a], 
    output_shape,
    grid=(SIZE,1,1), 
    spec=map_spec
)
problem.show()
```

```

## Puzzle 2: Zip 

Implement a kernel that takes two arrays `a` and `b`, adds each element together, and stores the result in the output array `out`. You have 1 thread per position.

```python
def zip_spec(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):
    return a + b

def zip_test(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint local_i = thread_position_in_grid.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 1 line)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="zip",
        input_names=["a", "b"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 4
a = mx.arange(SIZE)
b = mx.arange(SIZE)
output_shapes = (SIZE,)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Zip",
    zip_test,
    [a, b],
    output_shapes,
    grid=(SIZE,1,1),
    spec=zip_spec

```

## Puzzle 3: Guard

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of `a` and stores it in `out`. You have more threads than positions.

**Warning:** Be careful of out-of-bounds access.

**Note:** You can append `_shape`, `_strides`, or `_ndim` to any input parameter to automatically add that data as a paramter to your kerenls. So, in the following puzzle you could use `a_shape`, `a_strides`, or `a_ndim`.

```python
def map_guard_test(a: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint local_i = thread_position_in_grid.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 1-3 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="guard",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 4
a = mx.arange(SIZE)
output_shape = (SIZE,)

problem = MetalProblem(

## Puzzle 4: Map 2D

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of `a` and stores it in `out`. Input `a` is 2D and square. You have more threads than positions.

**Note:** All memory in Metal is represented as a 1D array, so direct 2D indexing is not supported.

```python
def map_2D_test(a: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint thread_x = thread_position_in_grid.x;
        uint thread_y = thread_position_in_grid.y;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 4 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="map_2D",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 2
a = mx.arange(SIZE * SIZE).reshape((SIZE, SIZE))
output_shape = (SIZE,SIZE)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Map 2D",
    map_2D_test,
    [a], 
    output_shape,

problem.show()

```

## Puzzle 5: Broadcast

Implement a kernel that adds `a` and `b` and stores it in `out`. Inputs `a` and `b` are arrays. You have more threads than positions.

```python
def broadcast_test(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint thread_x = thread_position_in_grid.x;
        uint thread_y = thread_position_in_grid.y;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 4 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="broadcast",
        input_names=["a", "b"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 2
a = mx.arange(SIZE).reshape(SIZE, 1)
b = mx.arange(SIZE).reshape(1, SIZE)
output_shape = (SIZE,SIZE)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Broadcast",
    broadcast_test,
    [a, b],

## Puzzle 6: Threadgroups

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of `a` and stores it in `out`. You have fewer threads per threadgroup than the size of `a`, but more threads than positions.

**Note:** A threadgroup is simply a group of threads within the thread grid. The number of threads per threadgroup is limited to a defined number, but we can have multiple different threadgroups. The Metal parameter `threadgroup_position_in_grid` tells us what threadgroup we are in.

```python
def map_threadgroup_test(a: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint i = threadgroup_position_in_grid.x * threads_per_threadgroup.x + thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 1-3 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="threadgroups",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 9
a = mx.arange(SIZE)
output_shape = (SIZE,)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Threadgroups",
    map_threadgroup_test,
    [a], 
    output_shape,
    grid=(12,1,1), 
    threadgroup=(4,1,1),
    spec=map_spec
)
problem.show()
```

```

## Puzzle 7: Threadgroups 2D

Implement the same kernel in 2D. You have fewer threads per threadgroup than the size of `a` in both directions, but more threads than positions in the grid.

```python
def map_threadgroup_2D_test(a: mx.array):
    source = """
        uint i = threadgroup_position_in_grid.x * threads_per_threadgroup.x + thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 5 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="threadgroups_2D",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

a = mx.ones((SIZE, SIZE))
output_shape = (SIZE, SIZE)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Threadgroups 2D",

    [11, 11, 11, 11, 11],
    [11, 11, 11, 11, 11]], dtype=float32)
```

## Puzzle 8: Threadgroup Memory

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of `a` and stores it in `out`. You have fewer threads per threadgroup than the size of `a`.

**Warning**: Each threadgroup can only have a *constant* amount of threadgroup memory that the threads can read and write to. After writing to threadgroup memory, you need to call `threadgroup_barrier(mem_flags::mem_threadgroup)` to ensure that threads are synchronized. In this puzzle we add the `header` variable as a new parameter to the `MetalKernel` object, which simply defines values outside of the kernel body (often used for header imports).

For more information read section [4.4 Threadgroup Address Space](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf#page=86) and section [6.9 Synchronization and SIMD-Group Functions](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf#page=177) in the Metal Shading Language Specification.

(This example does not really need threadgroup memory or synchronization, but it's a demo.)

```python
def shared_test(a: mx.array):
    header = """
        constant uint THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE = 4;
    """

    source = """
        threadgroup float shared[THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE];
        uint i = threadgroup_position_in_grid.x * threads_per_threadgroup.x + thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;
        uint local_i = thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;

        if (i < a_shape[0]) {
            shared[local_i] = a[i];
            threadgroup_barrier(mem_flags::mem_threadgroup);
        }

        // FILL ME IN (roughly 1-3 lines)
    """

    kernel = MetalKernel(
        name="threadgroup_memory",
        input_names=["a"],
        output_names=["out"],
        header=header,
        source=source,
    )

    return kernel

SIZE = 8
a = mx.ones(SIZE)
output_shape = (SIZE,)

problem = MetalProblem(
    "Threadgroup Memory",
    shared_test,
    [a],

```

## Puzzle 9: Pooling

Implement a kernel that sums together the last 3 position of `a` and stores it in `out`. You have 1 thread per position. 

**Note:** `threadgroup` memory is often faster than sharing data in `device` memory because it is located closer the the GPU's compute units. Be careful of uncessary reads and writes from global parameters (`a` and `out`), since their data is stored in `device` memory. You only need 1 global read and 1 global write per thread.

**Tip:** Remember to be careful about syncing.

```python
def pooling_spec(a: mx.array):
    out = mx.zeros(*a.shape)
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):
        out[i] = a[max(i - 2, 0) : i + 1].sum()
    return out

def pooling_test(a: mx.array):

## Puzzle 10: Dot Product

Implement a kernel that computes the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Coordinate_definition) of `a` and `b` and stores it in `out`. You have 1 thread per position. You only need 2 global reads and 1 global write per thread.

**Note**: For this problem you don't need to worry about number of reads to the `threadgroup` memory. We will handle that challenge later.

```python
def dot_spec(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):

## Puzzle 11: 1D Convolution

Implement a kernel that computes a 1D convolution between `a` and `b` and stores it in `out`. You need to handle the general case. You only need 2 global reads and 1 global write per thread.

```python
def conv_spec(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):

    len = b.shape[0]

## Puzzle 12: Prefix Sum

Implement a kernel that computes a sum over `a` and stores it in `out`. If the size of `a` is greater than the threadgroup size, only store the sum of each threadgroup.

We will do this using the [parallel prefix sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum#Parallel_algorithms) algorithm in `threadgroup` memory. In each step, the algorithm will sum half of the remaining elements together.

```python
THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE = 8
def prefix_sum_spec(a: mx.array):
    out = mx.zeros((a.shape[0] + THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE - 1) // THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE)
    for j, i in enumerate(range(0, a.shape[-1], THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE)):
        out[j] = a[i : i + THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE].sum()
    return out

def prefix_sum_test(a: mx.array):
    header = """
        constant uint THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE = 8;
    """

    source = """
        threadgroup float cache[THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE];
        uint i = threadgroup_position_in_grid.x * threads_per_threadgroup.x + thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;
        uint local_i = thread_position_in_threadgroup.x;
        // FILL ME IN (roughly 14 lines)
    """

## Puzzle 13: Axis Sum

Implement a kernel that computes the sum over each column in the input array `a` and stores it in `out`.

def axis_sum_spec(a: mx.array):
    out = mx.zeros((a.shape[0], (a.shape[1] + THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE - 1) // THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE))
    for j, i in enumerate(range(0, a.shape[-1], THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE)):
        out[..., j] = a[..., i : i + THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE].sum(-1)
    return out

## Puzzle 14: Matrix Multiply!

Implement a kernel that multiplies square matrices `a` and `b` and stores the result in `out`.

**Tip**: The most efficient algorithm will copy a block of data into `threadgroup` memory before computing each of the individual row-column dot products. This is straightforward if the matrix fits entirely in `threadgroup` memory (start by implementing that case first). Then, modify your code to compute partial dot products and iteratively move portions of the matrix into `threadgroup` memory. You should be able to handle the hard test in 6 device memory reads.

```python
def matmul_spec(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):
    return a @ b

def matmul_test(a: mx.array, b: mx.array):
    header = """
        constant uint THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE = 3;
    """

    source = """
        threadgroup float a_shared[THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE][THREADGROUP_MEM_SIZE];

## Metal Debugger

A useful resource when writing Metal code is the Metal Debugger in Xcode. You can capture GPU work from any kernel by setting the environment variable `MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1`. This will generate a `.gputrace` file, which you can open in Xcode by running:

```sh
open custom_kernel.gputrace
```

Once opened you'll be able to profile the GPU trace to view its performance. Here is a basic guide to locate the kernel debugger and view kernel statistics. 

First select `Group By Pipeline State` on the left sidebar, which will simplify locating the custom kernels `Compute Pipeline`.

![](/imgs/metal_debugger_1.png)

Next, local which `Compute Pipeline` contains to your custom kernel (all generated kernels will be prefixed with `custom_kernel_{name}`).

![](/imgs/metal_debugger_2.png)

If you click on the kernel name on the left sidebar you'll be shown your kernel code. From this page, you can select the bug icon to begin a step debugger for each GPU thread or view statistics for different parts of your kernel.

![](/imgs/metal_debugger_3.png)

If you can hover over one of the orange circles, you can view its `Runtime Statistics`.

![](/imgs/metal_debugger_4.png)

More information about the debugger can be found on the [MLX Metal Debugger](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/dev/metal_debugger.html) documentation or in the [Metal Debugger Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/metal-debugger) documentation.
